#### I had a lot of fun working on this one. I mainly used the rock, paper, scissors game for reference, and I glanced at another student's, Danny Yates, homework for a minute during the breakout rooms. The script.js file included is actually my second attempt to work out this problem, and I believe it helped me create a cleaner more logical code.
